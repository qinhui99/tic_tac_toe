I see the funny tic-tac-toe codes from https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook.

Since I am the fans of mxnet, I rewrite the codes in mxnet API. Although it is still naive, it works.

These codes are tested on mxnet 0.9. To run the codes ,you need to install mxnet(https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) firstly.
